# SaaSafras-Case-Study
This case study involves a scenario where I took on the role of managing a recently acquired business, SaaSafras. My primary task was to allocate employees effectively within the organization.


## Prompt:
Planterbox Inc, a plant care software business, just acquired a regional plant care operator
named SaaSafras based in the Southeastern US. SaaSafras’ business has been stable with
some organic growth and some natural churn. Planterbox has identified you as a rising star
within the org and you’ve been hand picked to run the newly acquired business after the
previous CEO of SaaSafras retired and sold their business. You’re excited for the opportunity
and your first project is to figure out how you can set up SaaSafras for long term growth
(Planterbox decided they loved the name too much, even though they acquired the company
they’ll keep the SaaSafras name).
As part of the acquisition, you’ve inherited 20 great people who can do it all between sales,
account management and support. Unfortunately, doing it all has come at a cost and
productivity has been lower than if they had specialized in any of the individual roles (and they
are begging for specialization as well). Going forward each person will only perform one core
role (SaaSafras has a high ownership culture and people will still regularly step outside of their
roles to help customers). Each person can only perform one role at a time but they can switch to
another role at the start of any month.
The three roles are:
1. New Business Acquisition
a. These people are responsible for selling and getting new customers in the door
2. Account Management
a. These people help existing customers; they drive revenue growth from the
customers they work with and improve retention
3. Support
a. These people solve customer problems; they improve retention for any active
customer
SaaSafras has some key metrics that won’t change with the acquisition. The business currently
has 1,000 customers. SaaSafras acquires 25 customers a month organically through great
branding and customer referrals. Some customers turn to other, more specialized solutions and
monthly churn is 10%. There has been a standalone support org in addition to your swiss army
knife team, and support’s CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) has been steady at 70% for several
years. SaaSafras doesn’t offer any discounts and every active customer pays $100 a month for
the core product.
You have to pick where your people are going and your goal is to maximize SaaSafras’ run rate
revenue at the end of the year. Depending on the specialization of the team they’ll move
different metrics.
The average New Business Acquisition person helps you acquire 5 new customers a month.
The average Account Manager helps reduce churn for the customers they manage by 5%
relative to baseline churn and they also increase revenue by 25% for all customers they
manage. If a customer has an account manager and then loses the account manager their
metrics (churn and revenue per month) return to the baseline, but there isn’t a negative
consequence. Each Account Manager can carry 25 customers.
Each support agent increases CSAT by 1 percentage point. Each point of CSAT leads to a 15%
relative decrease in churn.
SaaSafras needs you to make a decision - how many people will work on acquiring new
business, account management, and support? Why are they working there, and what’s your
plan to make sure you’ve made the right resource allocation decisions?
As a bonus: If you had to spend time working with one of these teams to improve the impact
that they could have on your organization, which would you focus on (Sales, Account
Management, Support)? What would be your plan to improve that team and what are the key
metric(s) you would watch to measure improvement?
